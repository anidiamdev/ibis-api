# Ibis
## What's the Ibis?
Ibis is a project of what we call a "social coin", is based on a concept of exchange and bardeling, and trading stuff and services for the improvement of a community's intern economy.

So for example if I ran out of tomatoes in my house, I can trade some for Ibis social coin.

And the why is basicly in the way we interact with the society that is external to our commmunity, by trying to indepent ourselfs a little bit more from it.

## The Github project itself.

So here, the project got to my hands, and I'm trying to, with a friend, do the logic for turning it into a digital system, like an app, like paypal.

## So This Is The Github For The Api

Of course we can't post all the user data and the implementation here, but, we'll try to make it so we share only the logics that dont expose the user data but our work.

## For This Project, What Are We Using?

For the api, we'll manage it all with flask and some other libraries, and the app is gonna be built in flutter.

This project is something that we consider pretty cool, and we hope you find it cool too.
